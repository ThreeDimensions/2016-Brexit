Two organisations have been founded within 4 days of each other reflecting the two sides of this wider debate, whether to remain in the EU, or to leave the EU.

With a Progressive strategy, you very much move your focus towards more educated urban areas, like London and university towns. This strategy will also help in Scotland, where the SNP reign supreme currently, but could potentially collapse throughout the campaign.
